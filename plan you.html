<h1><b><font size=200>Step 1. Figure out your travel budget</b></h1>

<h1><b><font size=200>Step 2. Choose a destination</b></h1>
<p>This step may seem obvious for some, maybe you already know exactly where it is you want to travel and that’s why you’re planning this trip in the first place. For those of you that have a destination nailed down, there are still a few things we’d suggest you consider, you can skip right down to the research step.It is simply not possible to go everywhere. Well, some people have done it, but if you are not on the quest to visit all 195 countries, you will have to decide every time you feel like traveling internationally, where to go. 

As one of the modern trends is a slow travel, which means you should spend longer in one country, try to capture all its colors and tastes, soak up the atmosphere and get to know the locals, you need to choose really thoughtfully your next destination. </p>

<p>You know where you want to go? Check. Have your visa? Check.  Flight Details, also known as Flight Service or In-Flight Services, returns scheduled flight information, including origin, destination, departure time, arrival time, flight time, travel time, meals, and additional information.

Now here comes our favorite part: It's time to book a flight!

First, you’ll need to answer these questions: What airport will you fly into? Are you going to make a round trip and fly out of the same airport? Or are you departing out of a new place? </p>

Don't hitch hike.
Try not to travel at night.
Avoid 'seedier' areas of the cities you visit, especially at night.
Ask your hotel manager for advice on 'safe' versus 'unsafe' local areas.Keep a photocopy of your passport and all other important documents in a safe place.
Use ATMs during the day, when there are people around.
