<h1><b><font size=200>Step 1. Figure out your travel budget</b></h1>
<p>Before you can even begin to plan a trip, you need to take a good look at your finances and figure out how much money you have to spend on your adventure. This will dictate a lot of the future steps including where you can travel to and for how long. </p>
<h1><b><font size=200>Step 3. Choose a destination</b></h1>
<p>This step may seem obvious for some, maybe you already know exactly where it is you want to travel and that’s why you’re planning this trip in the first place. For those of you that have a destination nailed down, there are still a few things we’d suggest you consider, you can skip right down to the research step.</p>
<h1><b><font size=200>Step 4. Book flights</b></h1>
<p>You know where you want to go? Check. Have your visa? Check. 

Now here comes our favorite part: It's time to book a flight!

First, you’ll need to answer these questions: What airport will you fly into? Are you going to make a round trip and fly out of the same airport? Or are you departing out of a new place? </p>
<h1><b><font size=200>Step 7. Get travel insurance</b></h1>
<p>Even though you might be safer abroad than in your home country, accidents happen everywhere and you should always be covered. We never leave home without travel insurance and neither should you.</p>
<h1><b><font size=200>Step 8. Minimize travel risks</b></h1>
<p>There are plenty of steps you can take before you even set foot in a country to minimize your risk of something going wrong.Ask your hotel manager for advice on 'safe' versus 'unsafe' local areas.Avoid incidents such as fights, riots or civil disturbances at all times.</p>
 <h1><b><font size=200>Step 9. Pack</b></h1>
<p>It’s starting to feel real now isn’t it?! Your trip is coming up fast and it’s time to get packing!

Packing for a trip can be quite the puzzle. You want to be prepared and make sure you don’t forget anything, but at the same time, don’t want to feel weighed down by too much stuff. 

If you’re a self-proclaimed over-packer, or someone who always ends up using only half the things in their suitcase on every trip… I’m right there with ya! We recommend planning out your packing ahead of time so you are not rushing at the last minute to get everything you need stuffed into your oversized suitcase. </p>
<h1><b><font size=200>Step 10. Last-minute preperation</b></h1>
<p>You’ve made it to the final step! Your trip is just around the corner and all that’s left is doing a little research and making some last-minute arrangements.</p>
